<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I have an idea.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Cara laid her pen aside. &nbsp;&quot;I wouldn't indulge you but I can't say I'm terribly inclined to continue my homework.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;With that logic I suppose I'm in too. &nbsp;Shoot away Jeff, save me from the horrors of Molecular Physics.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks for your belief in my creative genius, Vin.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Any time.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;So, back to my idea. &nbsp;Cara, you know how to program pretty well, right?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Over eight years of computer science courses tends to do that to people, so yes. &nbsp;If you're thinking of making me program some silly videogame with special cheat codes for you only, think again. &nbsp;I'm a touch busy finishing off my graduation project.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well sure, but Vin just gave you the final figures for torque-induced stress for your architectural program right?&quot; &nbsp;At a nod he went on. &nbsp;&quot;Well, with your graduation project almost finished I'm sure you're considering a few weeks in the Florida Keys, but wait! &nbsp;This deal may be even better.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Now I know he's full of it,&quot; said Cara. &nbsp;&quot;The only break I'm taking any time soon is a lunch break. &nbsp;Next month is job-hunting season, and though I loath the very thought of it I can ill-afford to skip it.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;But an idea of this magnitude would be wasted on a cafeteria conversation, surely you would not so demean an idea of such magnitude!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Hibachi?&quot; suggested Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Only if Jeff is paying.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Gladly. &nbsp;Let's get to walking.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;And give you more time to spout nonsense? &nbsp;Hardly. &nbsp;We're taking Vin's car or you can put an end to this thing right now.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It may not look like much on the outside, but nothing can beat Hibachi. &nbsp;Interesting business model though,&quot; commented Vin as they arrived, voice fighting against the Cara-controlled radio. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;There's really nothing that tops a fine Japanese-style filet cooked right in front of you. &nbsp;Microwave meals run in fear, Hibachi-steak is here. &nbsp;Incidentally...&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Cara, &quot;not yet.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You see that? &nbsp;Succulent steak cooked before your eyes in the hands of a master chef,&quot; pronounced Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't understand the fascination you guys have with steak. &nbsp;The chicken doesn't look that bad, and it doesn't ooze blood either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;However, red meat does--&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Enough, I'd rather listen to your fabulous new plan for world domination than debate further the merits of meat.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes Jeff, let's hear it shall we? &nbsp;Forgive us if we pay slightly more attention to our fabulous meal here than to you.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha, ha. &nbsp;Well then, seeing as you've come at least partially to your senses I suppose I shall condescend to instruct you in the fine art of imagination.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Get on with it already,&quot; said Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, alright. &nbsp;Vin, what would you say the worst thing about virtual reality games are?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, obviously, that they're still just virtual. &nbsp;Other than that I suppose they're great, better than what I had as a kid.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;True, true, but--&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We can do better?&quot; inserted Cara. &nbsp;&quot;I told you already I have neither the time nor inclination to create silly games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Aye, but I seek not to create a game, but Reality itself.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Mm?&quot; mumbled Vin through a mouthful of fried rice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is trying to work backwards: &nbsp;An orange, therefore orange and round. &nbsp;We need to go the other direction.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;How so?&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Caught your interest, have I?&quot; &nbsp;She frowned. &nbsp;&quot;Anyways, we need to start smaller. &nbsp;Enough building on the macro scale, enough building at all.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vin cleared his throat, &quot;Erm, Jeff, it might be time for you to depart the imagination train and get back to your Biology books.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Biochem books, thank you very much. &nbsp;We're a step above the rest -- More powerful than the Chemist and smarter than the Biologists.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;More powerful how?&quot; asked Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Chemists spend their time playing with elements; we biochemists get to the heart of the matter and manipulate life itself.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Enough,&quot; said Cara, setting aside the cheap wooden chopsticks. &nbsp;&quot;I think I'd actually like to hear what you have to say.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;But of course, I would never deny a beautiful women her desires.&quot; &nbsp;A blank stare brought him up short. &nbsp;&quot;Ahem. &nbsp;Now the key to what I'm saying here is that we have to build an organic world. &nbsp;What that means is that instead of constructing a world from the ground up, from what we can perceive with our eyes and pick out as objects, and go deeper - or smaller, if you will. &nbsp;Enough messing around with templates for fruits and skateboards, lets build a world that can build itself.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I wrong, or are you talking about forming things from their constituent atoms: virtual atoms, collected in a virtual world?&quot; asked Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I suppose we could go as low as quarks but I suspect that would be a lot of extra work for relatively little gain.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;If the shift from atoms to quarks isn't warranted, why the shift to atoms from macro materials? &nbsp;Isn't your goal to reproduce reality?&quot; asked Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It's true that that in and of itself is a worthy project, a perfect fixed mirror of reality; unfortunately I believe it to be impossible given our resources.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Not sure what you're standing on any more Jeff, and I'm all out of food,&quot; said Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well hold on a moment and I'll buy dessert.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose a little chocolate ice cream couldn't hurt,&quot; said Cara cautiously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Here's the deal: &nbsp;It would be a fool's game to recreate the Earth. &nbsp;It's simply too complex a project for us to do alone, if indeed it truly is even possible. &nbsp;After all, How can you get something inside the universe to encompass the universe? &nbsp;However, I think we're capable of making something similar and of potentially far more worth to ourselves personally.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Similar?&quot; asked Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Similarly complex to the naked eye, anyways.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see how making a model that is of comparable complexity makes the job any easier,&quot; said Cara. &nbsp;&quot;I still get an image of myself slaving over a keyboard with no clear end in sight.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there will of course be a few shortcuts that have to be taken.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The reason that Economics fairs so badly in predicting the future is that every such 'shortcut' undermines the model. &nbsp;The only true model of reality is reality itself.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but why should our project model this reality at all? &nbsp;Clearly it will be easiest to start in that manner, reproducing the atoms we all know and love and serve a worthwhile purpose. &nbsp;Still, we will make mistakes, I'm sure. &nbsp;Either through ignorance or human error. &nbsp;But when it happens, why not simply let our mistakes run free?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds a little corny,&quot; said Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I pour my heart out - and my wallet - to you and that's all I get for a comment?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What makes you so sure that life of even the most basic sort could arise from such a misbegotten world?&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well you've certainly gotten to the crux of the matter. &nbsp;Frankly, I'm not sure at all. &nbsp;Still, given enough time and reasonably fair conditions, what can be probably will be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;This is enough like a lottery ticket to make me wonder why I sank so much time into it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Come now Vin, have heart, will travel,&quot; said Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Guys, the visual interface is up and running. &nbsp;Put your gear on, let's take our first look at a brand new world,&quot; said Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Great, nada. We ran this thing for a week and we get a big gray nothingness,&quot; said Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, hold on &nbsp;a second,&quot; said Cara, &quot;forgot the shading coefficient.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, it looks better,&quot; said Jeff. &nbsp;&quot;At least now we have a moonlit beach. &nbsp;Anyone mind telling me where's the water?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;If Vin screwed up one of the formulas it could have spontaneously combusted for all I know so don't look at me. &nbsp;&quot;I'll bet it was Jeff's stupid addition of antigravity-atoms.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I think we should take heart that there is something to see at all. &nbsp;No one to my knowledge has ever done something like this. &nbsp;We've created a world rather than just an imitation. &nbsp;&quot;Still, I was hoping for something more.&quot; &nbsp;Jeff removed his VR goggles. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Assuming that we haven't simply added to the no doubt vast number of lifeless planets in the universe, I may be able to offer some hope,&quot; said Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be nice,&quot; said Cara, &quot;seeing as I quit my old job a month ago and am now without any money or prospects worth speaking of.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, frustratingly enough, for some reason our program is proving somewhat more complex than I initially estimated. &nbsp;As a result the effective flow of time is greatly reduced. &nbsp;we hoped for 500 million years during the initial week its been running: in actuality, closer to 10 million have passed. &nbsp;It might indicate that more complex structures are being formed. &nbsp;More dependent relationships in denser than normal random patterns might cause such a reduction in processing speed.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously we just need a faster computer then, right?&quot; asked Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cara deactivated the visual interface. &nbsp;&quot;I might actually be able to do something about that, but in the mean time you two should prove that this colossal time sink is worth my time.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; asked Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It means she wants us to double-check our figures, and perhaps reconsider some of our 'shortcuts', as you put it,&quot; said Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Excellent deduction Vin, now get out. &nbsp;I'm done for the night.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;See you tomorrow then,&quot; said Jeff as Cara flicked off the lights. &nbsp;Only the blinking of the computer tower remained as he shut the door behind him &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing, nothing at all wrong with our numbers. &nbsp;Barring some gross and yet undiscovered oversight, the water simply has to be there somewhere or another.&quot; &nbsp;Jeff motioned for Vin to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;In essence I believe he's right. &nbsp;It could be the antigravity atoms but I can't see how they could simply make the water disappear completely. &nbsp;I think we need to take another look at what we're dealing with, another peek inside the World.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;That will have to wait,&quot; said Cara. &nbsp;&quot;I haven't completed the sensory and manipulation interface as of yet.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We could still take a peek,&quot; said Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Why bother?&quot; responded Cara. &nbsp;&quot;Without the manipulation interface that's all it would be: a peek. &nbsp;Once its running we can do some digging, quite possibly literally, and see if we can find where all that lovely H20 is at.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;How long should that take you?&quot; asked vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on whether or not you want to feel human inside the virtual world or like an apathetic god; whether you want the true experience or if you want to be disassociated with the nitty gritty of the world, all senses dulled or lacking entirely.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The former?&quot; put forward Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Both have their uses, but presumably the former shall indeed be the more desirable. &nbsp;But for now all that will have to wait.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you acquired the computer resources we need yet?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well Vin, the answer is sort of yes and sort of no.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; asked Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what I'm looking at right now will give us about 100 times our current processing power with only very minor glitches. &nbsp;Unfortunately its not what's normally thought of as entirely legal.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Not entirely legal?&quot; said Vin slowly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you two just got cut off from your families' funds to keep you focused on your studies, right?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;That's true,&quot; said Vin. &nbsp;&quot;We would be rather hard-pressed to find a computer that powerful legally, wouldn't we.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;To say it lightly.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Just how illegal is it?&quot; asked Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Cara, &quot;it's not as if I'm hacking into the CIA or anything.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Out of curiosity, how about you tell us what exactly you are doing,&quot; said Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The thing is, now that myself and nearly everyone else ha either graduated or gone on summer vacation like yourselves, there's something of an opportunity at hand.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You've certainly got the thief lingo down,&quot; said Jeff. &nbsp;&quot;Go on, go on, I didn't mean to judge.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Anyways, the fact is, with only a small handful of people at the University during the summer a great number of computers are simply left dormant. &nbsp;Per operating procedure the computers are left in standby mode day and night. &nbsp;With a little work I was able to link all dormant computers together to form a sort of super-computer.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;That actually works?&quot; asked Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes and no; I certainly wouldn't call it ideal. &nbsp;There's about a 60% reduction in efficiency overall, but with literally hundred of unused computers on campus we still come out ok, even if the program continues to grow in complexity.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I assume if we get caught you're going to rely on Vin and I still being students for another year to justify the computer lab access?&quot; said Jeff glumly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Erm... yes. &nbsp;You might want to develop a fake multiple personality disorder to account for the multiple logons. &nbsp;However, unless they know to look for us there's not a chance the random sweeps and anti-hacker programs will pick us up.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no other options?&quot; asked Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Not that I can think of. &nbsp;Stop worrying so much Jeff. &nbsp;If we're going to do this we have to do it now. &nbsp;There's only three weeks of summer left and I can't afford to wait another year on this while you two go off studying.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;In that case it seems our path is clear,&quot; said Vin. &nbsp;&quot;We must act, and act now, if we wish our endeavor to come to fruition.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;if that is the only way then let it be so. &nbsp;I must admit that for the sake of law alone I cannot abandon this project.&quot; Jeff ran a hand through his hair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop being so dramatic,&quot; snapped Cara. &nbsp;&quot;I put it into place last night. &nbsp;Still, I'm glad both of you agree.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff replied angrily, &quot;I'm so glad our opinions matter to you, Mistress. &nbsp;Are their any other decisions you've made for us?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;If you want it that way then yes, I have. &nbsp;I'm putting together the most realistic full-sensory virtual reality system the world's ever seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't realistic and full-sensory a bit redundant?&quot; said Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Irrelevant. &nbsp;In much the same way I put together the world I've been able to construct the interface. &nbsp;The visuals were tough enough, and the rest is sure to have a few glitches as I try to mesh our senses to the output of the digital universe, but it should turn out to be spectacular.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well then,&quot; said Jeff, &quot;I guess my only question is whether there's anything left for Vin and I to do.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually there is. &nbsp;I need one of you to figure out how to sync your VR gaming gear with my interface. &nbsp;Eventually I want to try it with a full-sensory immersion tank but for now your ridiculously overpriced gear is the closest we can get.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't do it,&quot; said Vin. &quot;I'm having dinner with my parents and the new senator. &nbsp;I'll be gone until Tuesday.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Lovely, you go busy yourself in politics with the senator your parents no doubt bought into office, while I slave alone over our VR gear,&quot; said Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Mm... you did have a spare for me, right?&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;But of course. &nbsp;I'll alter it last so you can come by and play Slayer 3 if you ever reevaluate your stance on games.&quot; Jeff grinned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Hardly. &nbsp;Don't enjoy yourselves too much, I'm sure there will be plenty of work for both of you when Vin gets back trying to get this thing copyrighted and funded. &nbsp;I, on the other hand, have work to do right now.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Have at it then, I think I'll be off,&quot; said Vin. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds good. &nbsp;I guess I'll see you both in a few days, I need some time to focus.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone rang. &nbsp;&quot;Hey, Cara, I hope I'm not interrupting but I finished modifying the gear. &nbsp;Oh, and by the way it looks like Vin's going to be held up for another few days.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a shame that Vin won't be here because you're not interrupting in the least,&quot; said Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;How so?&quot; asked Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Come right over and make sure you bring your gear.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Such a tease. &nbsp;I'm on my way.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, what's the deal?&quot; asked Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Take a look at this,&quot; said Cara. &nbsp;&quot;I've been trying to crack it all morning but frankly I still don't have a clue.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this is indeed a puzzle,&quot; said Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You can't make heads or tails of it either then?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know that I'd exactly say that...&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Elaborate. &nbsp;Now.&quot; said Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Vin could tell you a bit more but it looks like we're dealing with a &nbsp;magnitudinal increase in complexity. &nbsp;I can't tell much from the readout conclusively except that things appear to have mobilized.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that it? &nbsp;I've been working on this all morning, I was hoping for something a bit more graphic.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you slow it down for me?&quot; asked Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Ya, I was going to anyways when we opened the interface. &nbsp;Did you want real-time or a split second shot like last time?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Singe frame, I guess, save the real thing for later.&quot; &nbsp;The display came up. &nbsp;&quot;Thanks. &nbsp;Can you color-code Hydrogen, Carbon, and Oxygen only? &nbsp;There we go. &nbsp;I don't know how you programmed that so quickly, but why should I be surprised after you've done all this?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;And that is...&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite possibly create the virtual equivalent of organic life.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What! &nbsp;We did it? &nbsp;Are you sure? &nbsp;It's only been running for a few weeks!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I wouldn't say I'm completely sure. &nbsp;Still, if you zoom in, there do appear to be some recognizable carbon structures. &nbsp;Not to mention I found the water. &nbsp;It's weird but it almost looks like all these rocks are floating on top of a sea, there's cracks everywhere so its not an underground cavern. &nbsp;Maybe those anti-grav atoms worked after all.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;But--&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Enough gabbing,&quot; interrupted Jeff. &nbsp;&quot;Let's take a look inside, aye? &nbsp;Let it run at real-time, but don't forget to switch it back afterwards, we don't want to stunt whatever it is that's growing in there.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer hummed with effort as the sensory interface engaged. &nbsp;&quot;It's... red,&quot; &nbsp;said Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Far as the eye can see,&quot; replied Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, lichen? &nbsp;The whole think looks like a desert coated in blood. &nbsp;Artistically speaking, it may actually be a step down from the barren wasteland we had before.&quot; remarked Cara bitingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Artistically speaking, art is a worthless pastime. &nbsp;What we have here is far more pure than art, it's life itself.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;So it is a plant or something then that's doing this?&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Of a sort. &nbsp;I wouldn't go so far as to classify their species, to be sure, but they do appear to be non-carnivorous at least, despite their color.&quot; &nbsp;Jeff smiled at her before crouching with his avatar. &nbsp;The avatar was only slightly heavier than the air that surrounded it, and his feet lifted off the ground for a moment before settling again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish the interface. &nbsp;Probably be a couple more days to get everything worked out.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;That's fine, sight and touch should be perfectly sufficient for a preliminary examination.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;And the verdict is?&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;That this plant, in non-scientific terms, is very weird. &nbsp;I suspect its cells have some characteristics quite unique to this world. &nbsp;Its not easily crushed, almost springy to the touch. &nbsp;There's something else too, I just can't quite place it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we should ruin it further,&quot; said Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I just mean that maybe we should wait for the Retreat to explore, in order to get the complete experience.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;So we are going to pay for a full immersion session?&quot; asked Jeff. &nbsp;&quot;That's not cheap.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I think a few hours would be appropriate and within our budget. &nbsp;Just wait a few days Jeff, that's all I ask. &nbsp;Then &nbsp;we'll be able to give this world the test run it deserves.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Vin, you made it,&quot; said Jeff enthusiastically. &nbsp;&quot;About time, too. &nbsp;There's only a couple days left until school starts. &nbsp;What took you so long?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Senators, congressmen, bankers, etc., I'm sure it would be boring to say more.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you take a look at the data?&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I did find time to at least generate an overview of it. &nbsp;The news, unfortunately, isn't likely to please.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Jeff. &nbsp;&quot;Its not the water, surely, we found where that went a while ago.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;So far as I can tell our physics generator and pseudo-chemical programs are running well. &nbsp;The problem is that they may be running too well.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;How can it be running too well?&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;No violent AI monstrosity has been realized into the world wide web I hope,&quot; said Jeff facetiously. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It's more an issue of storage and processing power, again. &nbsp;As it is, we simply won't be able to do the immersion session you suggested.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; asked Cara. &nbsp;&quot;We need that immersion session. &nbsp;Its the only way to see if the program is really working.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;There simply isn't enough processing power. &nbsp;More students are returning every day, taking up valuable computers and making the problem even worse. &nbsp;There's no way we could run the program at anything near real time, and some nasty things can happen to the physics generator if you try and run an avatar in anything near a still frame.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;If I must then I'll simply find some other colleges to hack into. &nbsp;I'm sure I can get it to work somehow, even during the semester,&quot; Cara paced the room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Cara,&quot; Jeff grabbed her shoulder gently. &nbsp;&quot;I want to see this project through just as much as you do, but this? &nbsp;I'm starting to thing you're growing obsessed. &nbsp;We need to take a step back, take another look at our options. &nbsp;What you're talking about, it's simply too risky, don't you see?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Risky? &nbsp;Risky is waiting, risky is not following through despite the obstacles. &nbsp;Finishing is the hardest thing anyone ever does, but I find it far less risky than the alternative.&quot; &nbsp;She stepped back and raised her eyes to them. &nbsp;&quot;You seem so young. &nbsp;You're still in school, still focusing on the difference between an A and a B on your inevitably bright future. &nbsp;I think you fail to realize just how much I've invested in this, and what it means for me if it fails.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen Cara, give me a couple days, I think I can find a solution,&quot; said Vin. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cara's hair was slightly frazzled, eyes narrowed on the two of them. &nbsp;&quot;What is this supposed to be? &nbsp;Is this some sort of sick joke?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You got your payment too then? &nbsp;I was starting to wonder if I shouldn't tell you to go check your mail and ruin the surprise.&quot; Jeff's smile died as she focused on him. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I to understand you were in on this too? &nbsp;Vin what were you thinking? &nbsp;Did you think I would be ok with this? &nbsp;You sold my project!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Cara, its a very fair payment, did you look at it yet? &nbsp;Fifty thousand dollars cash and the equivalent in shares, which have already tripled in value since the stock released. &nbsp;Not to mention your name on the project, you'll be able to get a job anywhere after this.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Jeff, enough. &nbsp;I want to hear it from you Vin, I want to hear what you were thinking when you sold me out.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Cara, I didn't sell you out. &nbsp;We needed more resources than we had, and I wanted to actually get them legally for a change. &nbsp;You think someone gives you a hundred thousand for startup costs without expecting nothing in return? &nbsp;Do you think the three of us together have enough time to polish off such a large project enough to sell it at the price it deserves to consumers? &nbsp;Let alone the expense and time of maintenance and security, the latter of which I'm not sure even you could pull off without a hitch, and one loophole in the code could cost us the entire project.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You really thought I'd be ok with this?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, it was the only way. &nbsp;My father agreed to the deal based on the assumption that I would wash my hands of it and get on with my schoolwork. &nbsp;We'll probably make half a million each off this project in the long run, we weren't going to get a better deal than that. &nbsp;Besides, now you'll have time to really enjoy it. &nbsp;I'll help you set up your own custom avatar tonight, and you won't believe what NewEarth looks like now (that's the name the advertising team chose by the way, not me).&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't deal with you two right now. &nbsp;The fact you thought that it would be fine and dandy for strangers to play around with my code, my first real program worth talking about, just shows me that you don't know anything about me. &nbsp;I thought we were friends.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff and Vin watched her go in stunned silence. &nbsp;&quot;I didn't expect that,&quot; said Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I warned you she was starting to get a little obsessed,&quot; replied Jeff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You get this strange feeling she's going to go do something we'll all regret?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;There must be a way in,&quot; thought Cara. &nbsp;Gel encompassed her to the neck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Another minute and we should be ready for full immersion,&quot; said the technician.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be. &nbsp;I built the thing, I know the foundation security program for my creation, they can't keep me out. &nbsp;They wouldn't scrap it and risk ruining the program, they will have just reinforced it, I'm sure of it. &nbsp;I can do this.&quot; &nbsp;The words were whispers, slipping out unheard and unnoticed even by Cara. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;All set Miss Sylvanestre. &nbsp;Have a good stay at the Rainbow Retreat. &nbsp;You may experience a brief moment of disorientation.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her vision returned in a rush, a mosaic of paneled options floated in front of her. &nbsp;&quot;At 1000 dollars a day this had better work.&quot; &nbsp;Her stomach churned at the thought of Vin's betrayal. &nbsp;How dare he sell her out like that? &nbsp;The money might be good, or good enough, but she had plans that would now never come to fruition. &nbsp;She could have led the computer programming into the future, rather than working under the arbitrary commands of some corporate boss. &nbsp;But there was still options. &nbsp;She would find out what was inside, know what had come of her work, and then perhaps new plans might come. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She brought up the login screen for NewEarth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to NewEarth. &nbsp;Please speak your name and password or say 'tutorial'&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Override 04609.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome Cara, how may I help you?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The lazy fools,&quot; she said thought. &nbsp;&quot;I need to enter the game.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;NewEarth is not a game, it's a new life waiting to be explored.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well they've certainly added some namby-pamby phrases to your code book haven't they?&quot; &nbsp;There was no response. &nbsp;&quot;Can you get me in or not? &nbsp;I need a model compatible with a class four immersion tank.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;No models are currently unregistered. &nbsp;New model creation must be carried out by the independent company Sown. &nbsp;We apologize for the inconvenience, but it allows for the absolute best avatar creation and helps discourage hackers.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose that's what I am now, a hacker in my own system,&quot; said Cara. &nbsp;&quot;Would they notice an alteration of existing material? &nbsp;I don't care if you have to put me in a rock or a tree, but get me in there. &nbsp;I need to see what it's like, what happened to it, and I need to see it now!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What is this? &nbsp;My eyes are open but what I see cannot be believed. &nbsp;I speak, but my ears hear only the guttural growls of an animal.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop, get off me.&quot; &nbsp;The creatures held her tight, their speech as incomprehensible as her own. &nbsp;&quot;To what strange hell have I been placed?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A blow struck her, ceasing her struggles. &nbsp;Darkness took her, and she fell. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words met her as she awoke, though how they were words she did not know. &nbsp;Images flashed like lightning with each strange rumble that sunk into her body. &nbsp;She opened her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay back!&quot; &nbsp;She thrust forth a hand that was not hand and images of a past not her own flooded her mind. &nbsp;This monster, standing before her, swimming, flying, pulling her with flexed wing onto a boulder in the sky. &nbsp;Her hand, her wingtip, shot to her head as she rallied against the stampede of memories that were making her feel things, feelings not her own, a vague sense of kindness towards the monster that filled her eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She couldn't take it. &nbsp;Running, falling, and finally stumbling out of the cave she was struck with the force of blasting rain, chilling her wings and bringing sensations from her face that only confused her further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sharp rumble called her from the cave. &nbsp;&quot;Come back,&quot; she thought. &nbsp;&quot;That's what the creature said. &nbsp;An incomprehensible succession of growls and thrums, and yet, its almost as if I can feel the shape of it, sense the meaning.&quot; &nbsp;She let herself be dragged back to the cave. &nbsp;There were others here as well, dozens perhaps. &nbsp;Their faces, barely visible in the moonlight that filtered through the clouds, seemed to be caught halfway between panther and dolphin, all hard angles sheared off, ears nowhere to be found. &nbsp;She diverted her eyes quickly, their faces bringing forth a deluge of memories that she could little contain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nausea gripped her and she fell awkwardly. &nbsp;Her wings braced themselves by reflex against the pitted and cracked stone floor but recoiled against the pressure; wings returned to their folded position against her back she continued her backward fall. &nbsp;Half stunned she gazed up at the mass of them above her, faces lost in shadow. &nbsp;Were they hungry? Murderous? &nbsp;Surely that was just her fear speaking. &nbsp;For some reason, she thought she sensed their pity. &nbsp;Low chords began to thrum throughout the cave, pulses of near tangible sound that seemed to be directed from their wings, not their mouths. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her name was Cara, and she had managed to drop herself into a very strange world indeed. &nbsp;Cara's feather wings, alleyim, fluttered in the light breeze. &nbsp;Her hands, such as they were, flicked out briefly to ricochet her off floating rocks. &nbsp;Rubber wings, flippers really, the denin were situated lower along her back. &nbsp;Gray on the underside and black above, they represented a starker beauty than the vibrant bronze of the feathers that covered the rest of her body. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sun was drifting down now, the lift was at its apex. &nbsp;Before long, every rock in the sky would start to fall. &nbsp;Slowly at first, they would rapidly accelerate when the last rays of the sunlight faded. &nbsp;A glint stood on the horizon, a reflection from a wall of glass stretching from the ocean floor to a mile in the sky. &nbsp;the structure changed daily, painstakingly constructed and regulated by an army of computer programmers and architects, or so she guessed. &nbsp;The universe Cara had helped to create was a touchy thing. &nbsp;Nothing not already provided for by the program itself could be added, and everything followed the peculiar laws of physics that governed here. &nbsp;Those poor souls accustomed to the godlike power of programming must certainly feel humbled now, though surely none more so than herself. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It's amazing how long I've been in here.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you say, Nomi?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A surge of anger swept through her at his words. &nbsp;Alleyk was her... friend, of sorts. &nbsp;This body she wore had a past all its own. &nbsp;Cara had understood very little of what the tribe members had said at first, but Alleyk had been a comforting presence, of sorts. &nbsp;At first she had been loathe to leave the cave without him. &nbsp;When she had finally understood the relationship she was supposed to have with him it had been too late to entirely disabuse him of the notion. &nbsp;He was a good sort after all, and even if she hadn't completely gotten over her innate fear of their features she had no wish to hurt him. &nbsp;Still, this simply couldn't stand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Alleyk, sit.&quot; &nbsp;She had a lot to say, and she didn't intend that he miss a word of it to the wind as they flew. &nbsp;Clawed, ankle-less feet gracing the stone she anchored herself to a floating rock about the size of a small cabin. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not Nomi.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, you're not Nomi? &nbsp;I know you're having trouble remembering things but you're still you, right?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean I've been trapped in here for a month. &nbsp;In this body, in this world, in these memories that are not my own. &nbsp;I don't hate you Alleyk, but my name is Cara, for what little justice this language does the name, and I swear I'll go crazy if you call me Nomi again?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you gone crazy?&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;This world is crazy! &nbsp;Nothing here is real. &nbsp;I touch, I feel, I suffer, I rejoice in the freedom of flight, but in the back of my mind I cannot forget that I am not truly here, that here does not exist.&quot; &nbsp;She pointed with her denin. &nbsp;&quot;There lies my freedom. &nbsp;Trapped in a body devoid of an interface, of any way to divest myself of this prison of flesh, of code, therein lies my only hope of escape.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You would go to where the ghosts dance?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Incredible, It's hardly been here two months, little longer than myself, and you've already incorporated it into your religion.&quot; &nbsp;In her memories, Nomi's memories, she looked up to him as a protector, a thing to be worshipped. &nbsp;In her view he seemed nothing more than a child, despite his stature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We should go talk to Eldest, you're scaring me.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Help me get to that place or I swear I'll never speak to you again.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>His face melted and hse nearly relented, memories swirling and assaulting her with alient emotions. &nbsp;No, she would stand firm. &nbsp;She was Cara, Nomi was nothing but an illusion, a rogue fragment of code. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A brief pulse of frustration escaped Alleyk before he dove into the air, Cara close behind. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rock shattered, roots and grubs snatched hungrily from the air by Alleyk. &nbsp;Cara, grimacing, grabbed a couple tubers before they fell beneath the ocean waves. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you truly not break them apart or do you just not want to?&quot; asked Alley. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I tried, really I did. &nbsp;Every time I try and change my pitch, to shiver the rock, everything goes haywire. &nbsp;Can't we try fishing? &nbsp;I've always liked sushi - ignore the word - and I'm hungry enough to get over the idea of killing a fish. &nbsp;I've been here for two months and I've never been down there. &nbsp;None of Nomi's memories show anything of it either.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Women don't go beneath the waves, it's not safe. &nbsp;Try again with this rock here.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wall of glass was not a wall at all, but a web. &nbsp;Lightly tinted with prismatic color, it stretched beyond sight above them and down beneath the ocean waves. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cara felt strong in her new body, fortified by a week of flying. &nbsp;Pressed by Alley's insistent reminders she had managed to keep herself fed, if only barely. &nbsp;Meals were not put together in 1000 calorie fast-food bags, it required a lot of work for relatively little gain. &nbsp;It didn't help that it still took her over a minute to hit the right frequency to shatter the boulders. &nbsp;Still, she didn't feel anywhere near strong enough to fly into orbit, which is practically what it would take to fly over the thing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had been distorted by the glass from afar but from here the islands were clearly visible. &nbsp;One, 100 yards across, was nearly level with them, floating not fifty feet away. &nbsp;The other, a full mile in diameter, lay lightly on the ocean's surface despite the numerous marble buildings weighing it down. &nbsp;A rope elevator with a simple counterweight system was the only congress between the two. &nbsp;Obviously not a destination for those afraid of heights. &nbsp;Ropes tethered the island to the glass wall and large, slow fans helped stable it. &nbsp;A light shined from the lower island, bright as day, trained firmly on the underside of the smaller. &nbsp;it took a moment to recognize the significance. &nbsp;&quot;They're actually powering that thing 24/7 to keep the anti-grav atoms from losing their kick come nighttime.&quot; &nbsp;Worth the investment, she supposed. &nbsp;Having it crash and knock them back into the stone age would no doubt cost them a fortune in lost programming hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You confuse me when you talk like that, Cara. &nbsp;Sometimes I wish Nomi...&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry Alleyk, remember what Eldest said? &nbsp;She's just taken another step in the journey. &nbsp;She's out there somewhere, in another world, another time, living a new life or expanding on the one she had.&quot; &nbsp;She brushed his alleyim reassuringly. &nbsp;Alleyk's denin emitted the chaotic, pulsing sounds that were the Vayan's equivalent of crying. &nbsp;&quot;that's what Nomi told me when my mother died.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cara recoiled in distress of her own. &nbsp;Those words weren't her words. &nbsp;What had she been thinking? &nbsp;She had never even spoken to Eldest, never known Alleyk's mother. &nbsp;And yet... Even as she thought of them the memories poured forth, of fish from the depths shared out by Eldest, of Alleyk's mother cleaning her cut, of cuddling with Alleyk as the rock beneath them rose softly from the ocean in the dawn's light. &nbsp;The longer she stayed in this body the more of Nomi's life kept bubbling to the surface. &nbsp;She was losing herself. &nbsp;She couldn't bring herself to see them as monsters anymore. &nbsp;She couldn't think of her parents without seeing Nomi's parents in her mind as well, even sharper than her own. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Is she still in there somewhere? &nbsp;Will she come back? &nbsp;The way you flutter your wings when you wake, the way your face scrunches when you're annoyed, sometimes I forget you're not you. &nbsp;Please, tell me she's still alive. &nbsp;Nomi, answer me!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>His words hammered into her. &nbsp;She couldn't help it, panic filled her. &nbsp; &quot;I have to get out. &nbsp;I have to get out!&quot; &nbsp;She pounded her denin into the wall again and again. &nbsp;Her taloned flipper-like feet clutched the glass below her as her alleyim fluttered wildly to steady her in her unthinking attack. &nbsp;Something pulled on her but she did not slow. &nbsp;Cracks burst into being and in the space of moments an entire section gave way under the strain. &nbsp;A chip of glass grazed her cheek, burning pain a quick companion. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;... stop! &nbsp;You're hurting yourself!&quot; &nbsp;She collapsed against him, frenzied energy spent. &nbsp;Her denin felt bruised, lacerations dripping blood to fall to the churning sea below. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She breathed in slowly. &nbsp;&quot;I'm okay now. &nbsp;You can let go.&quot; &nbsp;With a remarkable show of strength he had carried her dead weight through the air to a nearby boulder. &nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry Alleyk, I sort of lost it there.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He still hadn't let her go. &nbsp;Worried no doubt that she'd hurt his precious Nomi again. &nbsp;She felt like a cad for the thought, after all it's not like he didn't have a reason to distrust her after that little display of insanity. &nbsp;&quot;Listen, I have to go in there now. &nbsp;It won't be too long before they patch that hole, and stronger than before.&quot; &nbsp;She could see several people gathered near the edge of the island in the sky, pointing at the breach and arguing profusely. &nbsp;It was odd, but from a distance they didn't look all that human. &nbsp;Admittedly they were only computerized avatars, but still. &nbsp;&quot;I have to do it,&quot; she said in response to his apprehension. &nbsp;&quot;I must. &nbsp;It's the only way for me to get back to my own body, the only way for Nomi to come back to you.&quot; &nbsp;She devoutly hoped she wasn't deceiving him. &nbsp;A random amalgamation of code, it was all too likely that Nomi, whatever she may have been, was gone forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm coming with you,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have to do that. &nbsp;It will be dangerous in there, the type of people with money enough to buy entrance to this place probably aren't going to restrain themselves when it comes to shooting animals for sport.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that what they think we are? &nbsp;Animals?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Less than that, probably, but with a little luck I can change their minds.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;If it's really that dangerous I'm coming with you, like it or not.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to what I'm saying, if I die in there then... then I'll return to my own body. &nbsp;If you come with me, if you got hurt... I could never forgive myself.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It's like you said: &nbsp;Death is a journey, an opportunity for a second chance. &nbsp;I won't let you go into danger without me. &nbsp;If you're going to go in there, it'll be at my side.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her bronze wings burst outwards, grabbing the air greedily. &nbsp;Alleyk's wings, blue nigh onto black, slapped concussively, rocketing into the air beside her. &nbsp;Energy burned along her back and wings, lightening her in the absence the midday sun. &nbsp;Wings locked outwards they flew easily through the breach, into the world of Men. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She hadn't been wrong from afar, their faces were difficult to recognize. &nbsp;The angles seemed different to her eyes, the colors alien. &nbsp;While admittedly she thought she saw a pair of elf ears she doubted that all the irregularities stemmed from eccentric programmers. &nbsp;She was so used to this body she wondered if her own eyesight would seem strange to her after so long. &nbsp;Cara circled the island twice, trying to decide if she should land or seek her fortune down below. &nbsp;It was strange to be confronted with humanity after so long, familiar fears of public speaking coming back to her. &nbsp;With a start she saw one man take a bow and arrow off his back - more than enough to decide her. &nbsp;A woman next to him lowered his arm but Cara was already darting downwards. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking the flamboyant route she plopped herself down in the town square. &nbsp;Alleyk thumped down beside her with a short stumble. &nbsp;She didn't fault his landing. &nbsp;the stone was unnaturally smooth and defied their instinctive effort to sink their claws into stone weakened by the antigravity particles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite surprisingly a number of people made a short gesture and abruptly turned to salt before fading into nothingness. &nbsp;Interesting log-out program. &nbsp;She gave a quick pulse to Alleyk, &quot;Stay calm, I've got this.&quot; &nbsp;She was getting a little giddy, her rescue now so near at hand. &nbsp;Still, Plan A was already a failure, the ground was far too hard to scratch out letters. &nbsp;People were approaching slowly now, the more curious among them less worried, no doubt, about losing the down payment on their avatar bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An odd thing happened as they approached. &nbsp;As their shadows fell on her in the low sun's light she crouched despite herself and choked back a hiss only with extreme effort. &nbsp;All of them stood at nearly twice her height. &nbsp;Alleyk was vainly puffing himself out besides her, feet arched beneath him with his claws barely holding him steady on the stone. &nbsp;In the fountain she saw then her salvation. &nbsp;Dipping her denin into the sparkling water she began to paint letters onto the slick surface. &nbsp;It was only a few at first but gradually the crowd's attention shifted. &nbsp;With pointed fingers and outstretched arms their eyes were drawn to her curious, barely visible writing. &nbsp;Alleyk seemed to relax slightly as most of them turned towards her. &nbsp;She, on the other hand, grew ever more ill at ease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They watched intently, yes, and that certainly suited her purposes. &nbsp;Still, their babble unnerved her. &nbsp;It didn't sound like English, nor any other language she had ever heard. &nbsp;Quite frankly, it barely sounded like language at all. &nbsp;Harsh and high pitched it pained her ears and she had to resist covering them in order to keep writing. &nbsp;She couldn't know for certain they could even see the letters from where they stood, let alone decipher her rough script through the countless careless drips, but she could hope, hope they weren't just talking about how best to trap her. &nbsp;&quot;HELP ME I AM HUMAN&quot; it read, hardly outset from its background in the low sun's light. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A chaotic chorus of voices surrounded her, one man approaching her threateningly. &nbsp;A short pulse warned Alleyk to stand down. &nbsp;Mouth working furiously it seemed as if the man before her intended to interrogate her. &nbsp;With her alleyim she lightly touched the sides of her head to denote the noticeable lack of human ears. &nbsp;With a grunt he bent down beside her after dipping his hand in the fountain. &nbsp;It was strange how aggressive they were towards her. &nbsp;Was it fear of the unknown? &nbsp;Did they struggle against the same instincts that were besetting her? &nbsp;She fought against the desire to bite him, trying to focus against the pounding in her ears. &nbsp;No, Cara suspected they weren't undergoing quite the same battle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;HACKER?&quot; it read. &nbsp;Of course they thought that. &nbsp;Foolish to think they had ever assumed some form of life could ever have arisen inside the program and lead to such a peculiar result. &nbsp;They might even suspect this was some sort of event put on by the company, or that she was some eccentric billionaire who paid for a heavily customized model. &nbsp;She could think of only one way to escape this place, only one way of possibly motivating someone, anyone to find her. &nbsp;Just before the shadows met them she managed to write one word: &nbsp;&quot;Cara&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That same moment something far worse than shadows distracted her completely from the man's gestures. &nbsp;Giants, barely human in appearance began to materialize around the square. &nbsp;Building up from the ground with salt the five of them suddenly took on life and color, the salt replaced with the computerized equivalent of flesh and bone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She couldn't help herself, a crack of her wings and she was aloft. &nbsp;Alleyk was quick to follow. &nbsp;Cara's lungs burned, body leaden in the twilight. &nbsp;They were not built to fly at night. &nbsp;The giants, unfortunately, were not much slower. &nbsp;Hovering in the air it seemed as if space folded around them as they moved through the air without any natural propulsion. &nbsp;One excruciating minute later she grasped hold high on the wall of glass. &nbsp;&quot;The break is gone, we'll never break through in time,&quot; said Alleyk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We have to go down to get through.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would we do that?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Look at the holes for air to pass through, they'll be bigger below sea level. &nbsp;Its the only way the wall could handle stress. &nbsp;Now go!&quot; &nbsp;He frowned but with a giant hand reaching towards them he managed to overcome his reluctance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The sea was far darker and choppier than it had appeared from afar. &nbsp;Anything might lurk beneath its surface, completely hidden. &nbsp;Perhaps she should simply try and go peaceably with the giants behind her. &nbsp;They had to be controlled by someone, and they probably weren't homicidal maniacs.... &nbsp;Right as she tried to break her descent her wings snapped in and closed tightly against her back. &nbsp;Throat closing of its own accord she plunged beneath the waves into darkness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pulses sounded from behind her, &quot;Come, the wall is this way.&quot; &nbsp;She floundered for a moment before she managed to progress towards his occasional locational pulse. &nbsp;Images came to her mind intermittently but without the flavor of memory. &nbsp;Shutting them out she simply continued to follow the pulses. &nbsp;&quot;We need to go deeper,&quot; said Alleyk. &nbsp;&quot;The holes are getting larger but I still can't fit through.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Lead the way, I can't see a thing.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Really? &nbsp;You just have to - never mind, we don't have time. &nbsp;Another minute and we'll need to be up on the surface. &nbsp;We're still running hot from the flight, our air won't last long.&quot; &nbsp;The current from his flippers brushed her face gently as she kept close to his nonexistent heels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Through here! &nbsp;I think we're free.&quot; &nbsp;His denim touched her shoulder and guided her through the gap. &nbsp;&quot;We must go quickly, they will have heard us.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't think they'll cross the glass, do you?&quot; asked Cara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Not them, those.&quot; &nbsp;She didn't know what he was talking about at first. &nbsp;&quot;They're coming! &nbsp;Quickly now.&quot; &nbsp;All was gray, rocks clanged together overhead, barely indistinguishable from the gaps lit only by twilight. &nbsp;There was no clear path upwards, the rocks were massed against the wall stretching outwards with no end in her limited sight. &nbsp;Did she sense something though? &nbsp;Some shimmering echo in her mind of a broken, moving wall behind her? &nbsp;&quot;Faster!&quot; pulsed Alleyk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The image filled her mind, stunning her with the blurred images of teeth and fins, freezing her limbs with fear. &nbsp;Pain bit into her, blood gushing into the dark sea. &nbsp;Following an unfortunately human instinct she streamed and water filled her lungs. &nbsp;A pulse ripped through her from above, stunning the piranha as an arm wrapped around her. &nbsp;Her head broke the surface, Alleyk dragging her briskly onto a rough, low-lying stone. &nbsp;Her chest heaved but she could draw no breath, her limbs would not obey her but lay like stones themselves. &nbsp;Cara couldn't believe she had once thought Alleyk a monster. &nbsp;Limned in the red afterglow of sunset, fearful love etched on his face, she wondered how she had been so blind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mask sat lightly on her, rich oxygen flowing across her lips. &nbsp;A slow tick sounded regularly, stemming from a heart rate monitor beside her bed. &nbsp;Her thoughts were still fuzzy as a doctor and two men in suits filed into the room. &nbsp;One was Vin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We had to pull you out of the tank, Miss Sylvanestre. &nbsp;Your lungs stopped functioning for long enough that your heart ceased beating. &nbsp;However, I believe the issue will not recur if you do not reenter the tank. &nbsp;I know this is a lot to take in but I need to inform you that you have a right under the circumstances to ask for a second medical opinion before speaking with the FBI agent behind me.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her heart fluttered and for a brief moment a red light lit the console beside her before returning to green. &nbsp;&quot;No, that will be alright,&quot; her throat hitched as her mind cleared. &nbsp;&quot;The cause has indeed passed.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The door shut behind the doctor, leaving her trapped with the predators. &nbsp;&quot;you were in a coma for thirty-eight hours,&quot; said Vin. &nbsp;&quot;I wasn't sure you were going to wake up.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Cara Sylvanestre, as you may have guessed we are not here for purely well wishing.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I did suppose.&quot; &nbsp;The glint in his eyes cautioned her against speaking further. &nbsp;No Miranda rights it seemed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Your court date is in three days for damages against the company NewEarth run by Vin Alcezar.&quot; &nbsp;Vin looked embarrassed but he did not turn away. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What did I do that would possibly involve the FBI?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Cara Sylvanestre stands accused of destructive hacking exceeding thirty five million in damages and the deaths of nearly three hundred U.S. citizens. &nbsp;At this moment it is nothing more than that, an accusation. &nbsp;Unless convicted, she should be afforded the same respect due to any other citizen. &nbsp;As you can see in her face, my client is still recovering from her recent lung and heart failure that resulted in a thirty-eight hour coma. &nbsp;I suggest a delay of the trial for two weeks.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Motion denied.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She couldn't help thinking her lawyer wasn't terribly good. &nbsp;He was young, he was free, and he had once more mentioned the crimes she was accused of, probably renewing the outrage of the juries. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;In that case I would like to ask Jeff Pazarra to take the stand.&quot; &nbsp;Jeff, with noticeable reluctance, took his oaths and slumped behind the podium. &nbsp;&quot;Have you ever in the past known Cara to do anything deliberately destructive or hurtful?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;No, never, she's even a vegetarian, most of the time anyways.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;So you think that nothing would cause her to do something like that which she stands accused of?&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An angry cry of leading the witness and a few questions by the opposing lawyer later an unfortunate sentiment came out. &nbsp;&quot;She was a little obsessed with the project, she even hacked into some school computers for more memory space, but it's not like I think she should go to jail. &nbsp;She'd never do anything like this on purpose, she just needs... a little help getting back on track.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frowns multiplied among the juries and Cara rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands. &nbsp;They burned from lack of sleep, and her forehead emanated heat from the strength of her fever. &nbsp;The pill had done nothing to calm its fury, and her skin held a sickly yellow cast. &nbsp;Ridiculous, after her funds with the retreat had run out it seemed as if no hospital wanted to touch her for fear of bad publicity. &nbsp;State mandated treatment amounted to an fever reducer and advice to try and lower her stress, unbelievable. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man she didn't know was at the witness stand now. &nbsp;&quot;I don't know what happened after I left, but right before the security team came and I logged out there was a creature in the town square. &nbsp;It definitely wrote the name Cara, it was unmistakable. &nbsp;Whoever it was controlling it, they were obviously unstable. &nbsp;I could have sworn the thing actually hissed at me once before it started writing its message.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cara wondered if it was the same jerk who had kept trying to interrogate her before everything hit the fan. &nbsp;What a headache she was getting. &nbsp;It was as if every one of the staring, angry people in the audience trying to get her condemned as a terrorist were laying their eyes on her like stones, pressing her down bit by bit. &nbsp;She someone call her name. &nbsp;The courtroom was silent. &nbsp;With a lurch she pulled herself to her feet. &nbsp;The bailiff lead her by the arm up to the stand. &nbsp;She had to hold back a sneer as they asked her to swear on the bible. &nbsp;God indeed. &nbsp; Such devout followers they were, seeking her blood so thirstily. &nbsp;She hoped Nomi was alright, was living happily ever after with Alleyk. &nbsp;Maybe her suffering was worth it if someone, at least, could be happy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hack into the NewEarth?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What did she have to lose, the outcome of this case was predetermined. &nbsp;She had no chance, no knight in shining armor ready to cut the noose and carry her off to safety at the last minute. &nbsp;Her life, even if they didn't kill her, was over. &nbsp;Let's see how far the truth can take me. &nbsp;&quot;Yes, I did, about two months ago. &nbsp;Terrible security system you guys have.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawyer's mouth twitched a little at the remark. &nbsp;&quot;Be that as it may, it does not grant you the right to break into their system as you will. &nbsp;Did you cause the damage to their system deliberately?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Odd question. &nbsp;Was he taking pity on her? &nbsp;&quot;Of course not. &nbsp;No one has even explained to me exactly what happened. &nbsp;Besides, why would I try and do something that nearly killed me? &nbsp;If, in fact, the two things are even linked in any way. &nbsp;How do you know there wasn't another hacker? &nbsp;Where one person can get in someone else can too.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You know that's not true,&quot; said Vin. &nbsp;&quot;You built in some backdoor to the system, you must have.&quot; &nbsp;The judge silenced him briskly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you trying to say that its mere coincidence that the second you exited the system the entirety of NewEarth disappeared without a trace? &nbsp;Every single person who was using NewEarth at that time abruptly died as if every cell in their bodies stopped functioning simultaneously. &nbsp;Somehow you turned a harmless virtual reality world into a weapon of death, and I think we'd all appreciate it if you told us how you did it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all gone? It can't be gone. &nbsp;I didn't do anything. &nbsp;I don't care if you don't believe me. &nbsp;I didn't choose to stay in that world. &nbsp;I was trapped there. &nbsp;Trapped in a body not my own, with no way of waking up.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murmurs sounded amongst the juries and the crowd. &nbsp;The judge was hard pressed to restore silence. &nbsp;&quot;You mean to tell me you spent two months in NewEarth without ever logging off? &nbsp;What were you doing all that time?&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Living. &nbsp;I don't think you understand what that world was for me. &nbsp;In some ways I think that world is more real than reality. &nbsp;You think I'm making this up? &nbsp;I have memories, memories of that other world that are even sharper than the ones I have of this one, more colorful and vibrant, less restrained with the words that so restrain our society. &nbsp;I remember growing up, stretching my wings to the noon sun, sheltering with my mother from the rain and waiting for Eldest to return with fresh fish. &nbsp;You think this world is all there is? &nbsp;That humans know everything about the universe, about right and wrong, about laws, about God? &nbsp;You're fooling yourself. &nbsp;You would call them inhuman, animals, monsters, but how is it that you define human? &nbsp;Someone good and caring, compassionate and reasonable? &nbsp;In that I believe they surpass you, or you would not be sitting here. &nbsp;You think that I am simply Cara? &nbsp;I remember being Nomi, I remember her parents, I remember her feelings, I remember living in her skin for two months, and all the time before as well just as I remember going to college or learning to ride a bike. &nbsp;Is it any wonder that I look at you askance when you inform me that somehow I've unknowingly caused the world I love to disappear?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You're saying you did nothing, nothing at all to cause the system failure?&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>She laughed. &nbsp;&quot;Are you so small minded that you seize the most inconsequential part of what I say? &nbsp;I am only here because I died and was brought back - by modern medicine I assure you. &nbsp;I claim no special relationship with god if that is what you fear. &nbsp;No, I believe in something else entirely. &nbsp;I think they might be right, those so called primitive creatures that dwell in what you so feebly call &nbsp;NewEarth. &nbsp;I think there are many worlds. &nbsp;I believe that this is not the only life we life, that no god guides our actions. &nbsp;We are ourselves. &nbsp;We are who we make ourselves to be. &nbsp;Though we all are unlucky at times, things will come around again, we will have our pain but we will have joy as well. &nbsp;Those worlds, those realities, are waiting out there, some where. &nbsp;I got back here by dying, otherwise I imagine I could have lived my life out there until this world was nothing but a distant memory. &nbsp;Maybe that's where they all are, those fortunate that live in that world, somewhere beyond our reach.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you saying that they were in fact fortunate to have died? &nbsp;Surely you cannot be suggesting that you are glad they died.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of the sort. &nbsp;If you seek to twist language at least do it competently. &nbsp;What I am trying to explain to you all is that perhaps this is not our only life. &nbsp;Perhaps it was their time to try something new, to toss off their tired lives and find what joy life holds anew.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cara stepped out from behind the stand and the pressure in her back eased. &nbsp;Her fever ceased abruptly, headache faded, her eyes opening wide. &nbsp;She advanced on the crowd and they shied away from her though here and there she saw wonder in their eyes. &nbsp;Her eyes glowed in the light of the sun as she walked from the courthouse. &nbsp;Wind played at her feathered wings and she beat them against the air, testing. &nbsp;Faces watched from the shadows of the courthouse. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me, lawyer. &nbsp;I must hearten you, for you have finally lost your tongue. &nbsp;Tell me, have you ever felt like if you could just reach out your hand; reach out and grasp what you've always wanted? &nbsp;Take ahold of some other life, some other world where the singer sings a different song, where pain and misery and needless, unreasoned cruelty are not commonplace? &nbsp;As if it existed right around the corner, so close you can taste it, feel it on your skin? &nbsp;As if all you had to do was take one, little, step....&nbsp;</p>
